# Driver Drowsiness Detection (in progress)

## Project overview
This Driver Drowsiness Detection system is designed to identify whether a driver's eyes are open or closed, using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes facial landmark detection and convolutional neural networks to analyze eye states from images, helping to increase road safety by alerting when signs of drowsiness are detected.

## Used libraries:
- OpenCV
- dlib
- NumPy
- imutils
- Keras
